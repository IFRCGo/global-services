## Capacity

Water treatment for a population of up to 10,000 people.

## Emergency services

This kit is designed for the treatment and distribution of water for medium size populations, providing up to 150,000 litres of water a day for a population of up to 10,000 people. This kit requires the availability of a local surface or ground water supply. Limited sanitation capacity for a first response is supplied within the kit as well as some trucking capacity. It can provide the transport of treated water to several distribution points (capacity of up to 30,000 litres of water a day) with limited possibility to set up different storage and distribution points (preconditions are the availability of flatbed trucks, fuel, road access).

Hygiene promotion, as well as training in the proper use of equipment supplied, is an essential part of the operation and must be carried out alongside distribution activities. Local water and sanitation technicians and Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers for training and distribution of items are needed.
