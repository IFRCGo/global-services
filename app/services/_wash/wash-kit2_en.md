## Capacity

Water treatment at household level for 2,000 people (400 families).

## Emergency services

This kit provides water treatment at household level for up to 2,000 people (400 families), with no central treatment or storage capacity. This kit provides very basic sanitation facilities for a small population and is designed for response to the needs of scattered populations at household level and when beneficiary numbers are limited.

Hygiene promotion, as well as training in the use of materials and tools in the kit, is an essential part of the operation and must be carried out alongside distribution activities. Availability of local water sources is required. Local water and sanitation technicians and Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers are needed to ensure that the beneficiaries are familiar with household level water treatment methods.
