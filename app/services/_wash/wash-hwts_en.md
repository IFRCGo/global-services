## Capacity

The Household Water Treatment and Safe Storage (HWTS) Module is a lighter configuration of a water supply Unit, with the capacity to design and implement a comprehensive household water program, including hygiene promotion and safe storage components.

The module is deployed to support host National Society in the establishment of a household water treatment programme in emergency, including:

The Module has the capacity to work stand-alone up to 4 months, based on monthly rotations. Additionally, it can be also used as a support for other Emergency Response Units during the emergency response phase or as a solution for exit strategy.

The number of people that can be served by the HWTS is not predefined. The minimum start-up capacity, however, is estimated in 1,000 families for the first month.

## Emergency Services

The HWTS module is a flexible tool, capable of scaling up and down the activities accordingly to the evolution of the context needs. The set of activities that the Module is prepared to carry out includes:

- Needs and situation assessment in terms of access to safe water at household level, (including aspects related to storage capacity, hygiene habits and practices, legal issues and local capacity to respond to the needs -market analysis- to look into different response options).
- Selection of beneficiaries (considering elements such as gender and diversity as well as potential vulnerabilities related to age or disability)
- Drafting of a Plan of Action, programme implementation and monitoring and reporting on results and impact.
- Selection of adequate water treatment system(s), training on them to the population and coordination with distribution teams for the delivery to the target community.
- Conduct hygiene promotion activities
- Carry out of activities aimed to ensure the access to safe water at community institutional and communal areas level.

To carry out these activities, the Module will be integrated by personnel with a combination of core and technical competencies. 

## Designed for

The HWTS can be deployed to settings where other water ERUs are not deployed, alongside other ERUs (M15/M40/WSR/Health) and can continue past other ERUs.
