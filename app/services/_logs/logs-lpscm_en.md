## Capacity

Among other services, LPSCM can undertake procurement for National Societies on an ad hoc basis, or through the use of framework agreements with suppliers. Framework agreements are used as an effective means of securing goods and services at a competitive price, while guaranteeing quality, quantity and delivery terms for goods that are procured frequently. 

In order to ensure timely response and minimize cost, LPSCM has pre-positioned stock in Dubai, Kuala Lumpur, Panama, Nairobi and the Canary Islands. Depending on the nature of the procurement request and inventory levels, procurement can be fulfilled from pre-positioned inventory or via ad hoc purchase of custom order inventory. In both cases, procurement fees apply. 

Procurement for IFRC humanitarian and development programmes funded by donors is undertaken by LPSCM and is mandatory in the following circumstances: all procurements of drugs and medical supplies; all international procurements; or when the National Society is unable to undertake procurement in compliance with donor requirements.

- **Mobilization of goods:** This service refers to the coordination, sourcing and transport of relief items from point of supply to first port of entry for IFRC humanitarian and development programmes in support to National Societies. Mobilization services ensure efficient and cost-effective sourcing decisions are made with a view to the needs of an operation as well as availability of relief supplies.  As part of this service, a mobilization table is prepared and maintained to consolidate and communicate relief supply needs. It provides operations managers and donors with real-time information on what relief items are required, what relief items have been pledged and what relief items are still outstanding.
- **Procurement and transportation:** This service refers to the purchase and delivery of requested goods and services, calculating the most cost effective supply chain that meets the time and specification requirements. LPSCM procurement and transportation services include: sourcing, tendering, supplier selection, transportation to final port of entry, insurance, and inspection.
- **Fleet services:** Vehicle Rental Programme, fleet management training and fleet development activities are delivered by the IFRC Global Fleet Unit to the IFRC's country clusters/offices and National Societies around the world.
- **Warehousing and handling:** LPSCM provides warehousing and handling services to National Societies. Warehousing and handling services to IFRC humanitarian and development programmes funded by donors, and implemented in support to National Societies, include: receipt, warehousing, and dispatch. National Societies who wish to stock humanitarian and development supplies can use the IFRC warehouses in Dubai, Kuala Lumpur, Panama, Nairobi and the Canary Islands. 
- **Contingency stock:**  LPSCM provides sourcing and pre-positioning of emergency response stockpiles in the warehouses of the Operational LPSCM units.
