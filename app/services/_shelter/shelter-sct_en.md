## Capacity

Convene the interagency shelter cluster at country level in natural disasters and co-lead the global shelter cluster on behalf of IFRC. To coordinate the Shelter Cluster at the country level, the IFRC deploys a SCT. The shelter coordination team serves as a ‘secretariat’ of the Shelter Cluster. Its dedicated, full-time staff work exclusively on coordination services to shelter agencies. The SCT is deployed through the IFRC Shelter roster of trained professionals and partner or network organisations.

Flexible team that can be adapted to the specific needs of established Humanitarian coordination mechanism in response to a natural disaster, as it is a flexible configuration of one or several individuals depending of needs and capacity of the HNS/government/shelter agencies.

## Emergency Services

The SCT is a flexible coordination mechanism. Its composition varies depending on the size and needs of a disaster. The IFRC typically deploys a dedicated team of 3-4 people, but if a disaster response requires additional support from the Shelter Cluster, the SCT can incorporate several additional roles. The key positions of the SCT ensure that core services are provided to shelter agencies, delivering consistent and predictable support that is easy for partners to understand.
