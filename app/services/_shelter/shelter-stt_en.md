- Project feasibility studies (market analysis relevant to delivering shelter programmes as labour, rental market or technical surveys).
- Analysis of local building practices and materials. 
- Construction management (quality control, specific expertise during construction phases).
- Design Safe shelter awareness sessions/materials (software component shelter intervention) for quality assurance and self-recovery (IEC materials dissemination, demonstration of key mitigation and improvements to be implemented on the shelter components during construction/repair/reinforcement...).
- Monitoring and evaluation of humanitarian shelter and reconstruction programmes (housing/infrastructure rehabilitation, people targeted satisfaction surveys).
- Definition of shelter interventions considering the use of appropriate materials and technologies, innovation and energy efficiency and specification development.
