## Emergency Services

Inpatient and outpatient emergency health services to provide clinical treatment for cholera patients. Services include: triage, assessment, medical treatment of cholera (oral and IV as clinically indicated). Non-cholera patients who present to the clinic will be referred to the most appropriate local medical provider.

## Designed for

Unit can be deployed within  48 hours upon receiving a deployment request, can be setup within hours once on site, is self-sufficient for 1 month and can operate for up to 4 months. Designed for the provision of fixed cholera clinical treatment services in communities with limited access to health care as a result of:

1. Population movement to areas where there are no pre-existing health facilities and cholera outbreak has been confirmed
2. Health infrastructure damages following natural disaster(s) where a cholera outbreak has been declared
3. Existing health facilities are overwhelmed by influx of patients and/or cholera-related health needs following a crisis

## Personnel

**Total:** Typically 26-30 people + 72-76 contacted locally

**Composition:** Doctors and nurses skilled in cholera treatment (including a comprehensive understanding of pediatric and maternal health considerations related to cholera), and experience with training other health professionals. Non-medical staff includes logisticians, administrators and site technicians. In addition to the deployed team, local health care professionals are integrated into unit as soon as possible with the aim of reaching or exceeding a nursing ratio of at least 1 nurse: 8 ward beds (24 hour services). Public health and WASH profiles can be added depending on the stated need and other resources available in the response.
