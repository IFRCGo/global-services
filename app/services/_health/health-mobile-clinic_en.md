## Designed for

Unit can be deployed within  48 hours upon receiving a deployment request; base of operations can be setup within hours once on site, is self-sufficient for 1 month and can operate for up to 4 months. Designed for the provision of mobile emergency health services in communities with limited access to health care as a result of:

1. Natural disaster with health infrastructure damage; mobile clinic is a temporary substitution of services while infrastructure comes back online
2. Population movement where groups of people settle in areas where there are no existing health services and no permanent health facilities
3. Migrant populations where groups of people are continually on the move; access to health services and/or permanent health facilities is difficult to predict
4. Conflict/tensions between communities; health facilities exist but communities canâ€™t safely access them
