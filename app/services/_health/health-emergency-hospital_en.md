In addition to deployed team, local health care professionals are integrated into unit as soon as possible with the aim of reaching or exceeding the following ratios:  anesthetic technician/ anesthetist ratio 1:1 with surgeons, 5 OR technical staff per OT table, nursing ratio of at least 1 nurse: 8 ward beds (24 hour services).

- **Ward/Inpatient Module:** Contains equipment and supplies needed to set-up and maintain an inpatient ward, including beds, bedding, nursing equipment and supplies for different patient populations; the same materials (or similar module) can be used to set-up an intensive observation care area for close observation and nursing care of acutely ill or injured patients, or those requiring observation post-anesthesia. Depending on the context, wards can be set-up by gender (male, female), age (adult vs pediatric), or health needs (maternity ward, post-surgical vs medical ward) and scaled to admission needs (e.g. Ward Kit contains 15 beds, but several kits can be sent if needed).
- **Isolation Module:** Contains equipment and supplies needed to set-up an isolation area for the admission and care of cases of communicable disease that need to be hospitalised, but require a separate care area from the general patient population; includes PPEs to maintain droplet and contact precautions in this patient population as needed.
- **Laboratory Module:** Contains equipment and supplies needed to manage a minimum diagnostic capacity that goes beyond point-of-care or rapid tests; includes capacity to implement a walking blood bank including the supplies needed to test whole blood for HIV, Hep B, Hep C and syphilis (and malaria for areas where endemic) prior to administration.
