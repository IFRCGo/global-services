## Capacity

The IPC configuration of the PH ERU will support and strengthen existing health facilities in their capacity to continue essential health services in a safe manner during disease outbreaks, with a focus on infection prevention and control. Primarily to prevent  health care facilities from spreading infectious agents and secondarily to enable the health facilities to continue their activities in a safer manner for staff and patients and therewith reduce morbidity and mortality affecting  communities experiencing or at risk of epidemics. (UNDER DEVELOPMENT 2020)

## Emergency Services

Provide support to existing health facilities in IPC, including triage and isolation procedures and patient flows, to ensure safe continuation of care for all patients coming to the facility. Provide training to all health post workers (inclusive non-medical personnel) for appropriate IPC in general, and specifically towards the outbreak scenario in question.  Provide easy to follow protocols and health education materials for the health facilities. Support the health facility to organize patient flow / care from a good IPC perspective. Support in set up triage and, if necessary, isolation ‘waiting area’. Provide Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and other needed materials to facilitate hand hygiene, patient care equipment cleaning, and environmental cleaning (e.g. disinfection equipment, water points, hand washing points, chlorine, buckets, back-sprayer) to be able to carry out these IPC activities. If necessary, support in setting up / implementing minimum requirements for waste and wastewater management. Advice in possible referral systems / referral structures for these patients. Refresher trainings and possible supply of consumable materials regularly until the outbreak is over. Including and training the volunteers of RC/RC is an integral part of this ERU. Both for the volunteers to implement universal precautions during their work in the communities and prevent infection during their work, but also to be able to sensitize the communities around the health posts about the outbreak disease in question, as well as possible new implemented ways of working in the health facilities this community uses.
