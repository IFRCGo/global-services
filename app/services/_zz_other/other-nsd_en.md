## Overview

Strengthening of National Societies is one of the Federation’s and particularly the IFRC Secretariat’s fundamental tasks. National Societies work in a diverse range of contexts and cultures, face many and differing challenges, and also vary in their capability. The IFRC Secretariat and National Societies partner with and provide support to individual National Societies in their efforts to develop their organizational capacity and effectiveness.

The development support provided to an individual National Society will depend on its current situation and priorities. National Societies may wish to develop their auxiliary role, strategy, governance and accountability; strengthen areas such as financial management, communications, fundraising; increase volunteer engagement; improve external relations; or ramp up their preparedness for responding to emergencies or improve the planning and execution of programmes and services they provide.
