## Overview

Military and civil defence assets are often the first capabilities engaged in a domestic response, as well as offered by neighbouring states, and can make a valuable contribution in responding to natural disasters. However, the modus operandi of these mechanisms should be well regulated and coordinated with humanitarian organisations who share the same space. Disaster responses increasingly have a domestic and/or international military/police component that interact with RCRC Movement components responding on the ground. This necessitates a clear and common approach to Civil-Military Relations (CMR) by Red Cross Red Crescent (RCRC) Movement components to ensure a principled and effective response. Where the level of interaction with armed actors is (or can be expected to be) high, then the deployment of a CMR Coordinator is recommended.
