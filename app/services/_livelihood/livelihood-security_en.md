## Capacity

Surge Operational Capacity for Basic needs, Food security and Livelihoods in emergencies can be provided through the deployment of individuals or a team to support Emergency responses.

National Societies can be supported in needs assessment, identification of the response options for Area of Focus 3 (AoF 3), development of a strategy, capacity strengthening, drafting of the Emergency Plan of Action (AoF 3) and implementation.

## Emergency Services

Provide support in Food and basic needs responses in emergencies operations through a roster of trained professionals in IFRC and partner National Societies.

Different role profiles have been developed as part of the FSL Technical Competency framework. The profiles to be deployed take into account a wide range of competencies based on the type of disaster,  livelihoods activities (or livelihoods groups) of affected population and the context (Urban/rural). However, basic requirement include: Livelihoods framework, skills in data collection, planning, and strong understanding of the different modalities of interventions (in-kind, voucher and cash assistance).

When no technical delegate is deployed, remote technical support (to NS or IFRC Operation Managers) can be considered, on a case by case basis, upon availability of staff from IFRC or the Livelihoods Resource Centre (LRC).

## Designed for

In emergencies, priority is to identify the impact in terms of food and basic needs, identify main sources of food and income before the disaster and coping strategies to:

- Respond to immediate needs for food and basic needs assistance but also, 
- Prevent further deterioration of the situation by identifying risks related to further depletion of household personal / productive assets and negative coping strategies. 
- Set a conducive environment to promote recovery of economic activities and food production for sustainable impact on individual, households and communities.

Profiles deployed in emergencies have to be able to conduct rapid socio-economic analysis to understand the nature of the gaps in access to, availability and utilisation of food and basic services.

Data collection from main market stakeholders is also necessary to ensure that the response options provide quality assistance to meed immediate basic needs for the entire duration of the gap through the most appropriate modality (In-kind, voucher, cash or a combination of the different modalities). 

Livelihoods recovery starting with replacement of assets but also strengthening through capacity building should also be included in the response strategy to phase out emergency assistance as soon as possible. 

Other tasks include:
- Draft of Emergency Appeals / Emergency Plan of Action, budgeting
- Design of response options need to be gender-sensitive and inclusive
- Draft SOPs for quality selection and implementation of holistic Food security and livelihoods responses 
- Capacity strengthening in Food assistance, basic needs and livelihoods
- Procurement / distribution of food, seeds, tools, livestock or other assets in emergencies
- Strong understanding of Cash and voucher assistance
- Coordination within the RCRC movement and other coordination mechanism specific to FSL (Food security cluster, Early Recovery Working groups)  

## Personnel

Ideally a team of several. Can be 1 person or a team with several members with 3-4 different profiles. Usually 1 person as part of the surge deployment. Need to work closely with Cash and Voucher Delegate(s). Depending on the type of disaster, scope, context.
