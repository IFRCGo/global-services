## Capacity

Among other services, LPSCM can undertake procurement for National Societies on an ad hoc basis, or through the use of framework agreements with suppliers. Framework agreements are used as an effective means of securing goods and services at a competitive price, while guaranteeing quality, quantity and delivery terms for goods that are procured frequently. In order to ensure timely response and minimize cost, LPSCM has pre-positioned stock in Dubai, Kuala Lumpur, Panama, Nairobi and the Canary Islands. Depending on the nature of the procurement request and inventory levels, procurement can be fulfilled from pre-positioned inventory or via ad hoc purchase of custom order inventory. (In both cases, procurement fees apply). Procurement for IFRC humanitarian and development programmes funded by donors is undertaken by LPSCM and is mandatory in the following circumstances: all procurements of drugs and medical supplies; all international procurements; or when the National Society is unable to undertake procurement in compliance with donor requirements.
